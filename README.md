# pa-ffmpeg-scripts

A directory of useful pulseaudio and ffmpeg scripts.

## Files

#### sink.sh

Most important one, creates a virtual sink (and loopback) for you to fiddle with.

#### echo.sh

~~Runs ffplay with the correct arguments to hear the sink.~~  
No longer required as module-loopback is implemented.

#### speak.sh

~~Basic espeak wrapper, with my favorite config included. Also spanws ffplay (a bit laggy) to echo back audio.~~
Basic espeak wrapper.

#### speak.py

Basic festival wrapper, please use in speak.sh.

#### mspeak.sh

Spawns 3 TCP servers,

    - Port 3351: female voice espeak input
    - Port 3352: male voice espeak input
    - Port 3353: raw webm input to play back

and writes process IDs to `pids`.

#### pids

Generated by `mspeak.sh`, stores PIDs of the spawned processes in a `pid1 pid2 pid3` format.

#### kspeak.sh

Attempts to kill said processes.

## Dependecies

Since I only ever use this on my Mint setup, I only gave the `apt` dependecies.

    - For espeak voices, `mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2`
    - For festival engine, (optional) `festival python3`
    - For sound, `pulseaudio`

All mbrola packages are in pacman repositories too. Just a little naming difference. You won't need to modify anything in order for it to work on other distros AFAIK.
